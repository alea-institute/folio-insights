# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-17)

**Core value:** Every piece of actionable legal advocacy knowledge must be discoverable by task, mapped to FOLIO concepts, and structured for practitioners, AI systems, and developers.
**Current focus:** Phase 01.1 Upload & Processing UI -- Plans 01-03 complete, Plan 02 backfilled, continuing to Plan 04

## Current Position

Phase: 01.1 of 4 (Upload & Processing UI)
Plan: 3 of 4 in current phase (01.1-02 backfilled, 01.1-04 remaining)
Status: Plan 01.1-02 Complete
Last activity: 2026-03-18 -- Completed 01.1-02 (processing engine backend)

Progress: [████████░░] 87%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 7
- Average duration: 11.1 min
- Total execution time: 1.42 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-knowledge-extraction-pipeline | 4/4 | 71 min | 17.8 min |
| 01.1-upload-processing-ui | 3/4 | 14 min | 4.7 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 40 min, 4 min, 2 min, 5 min, 3 min
- Trend: Fast (backend plans execute quickly with clear patterns)

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Extend folio-enrich via bridge adapter, not modify its internals
- [Roadmap]: 3-phase structure following pipeline data dependencies (Extract -> Task Tree -> OWL)
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 includes full extraction pipeline end-to-end (ingestion through quality output)
- [01-01]: Used importlib for folio-mapper bridge to avoid sys.path namespace conflict with folio-enrich's app package
- [01-01]: Added local markdown element parser to supplement folio-enrich's MarkdownIngestor which strips headings without returning structural elements
- [01-01]: folio-python added as direct dependency for FolioService singleton access
- [01-02]: Tier 1 structural heuristics handle headings (1.0), list items (0.9), paragraphs (0.7), transition words (0.8)
- [01-02]: Tier 2 semantic segmentation uses all-MiniLM-L6-v2 with cosine similarity threshold 0.3
- [01-02]: FourPathReconciler wraps base Reconciler unmodified; semantic +0.1 boost, heading +0.05 boost
- [01-02]: HeadingContextExtractor proximity weights: immediate=1.0, parent=0.7, chapter=0.4
- [01-02]: Near dedup at cosine 0.85 matches folio-enrich EMBEDDING_AUTO_RESOLVE_THRESHOLD
- [01-03]: PipelineCheckpoint uses static methods (not Pydantic model) for simpler save/load API
- [01-03]: Three separate JSON output files: extraction.json, review.json, proposed_classes.json for different consumers
- [01-03]: CLI uses local imports for lazy loading to avoid heavy bridge deps on --help
- [Phase 01-04]: FastAPI with aiosqlite for async SQLite review persistence (no ORM, direct SQL)
- [Phase 01-04]: SvelteKit adapter-static for SPA mode served by FastAPI StaticFiles
- [Phase 01-04]: Keyboard shortcuts dispatched globally with focus-context awareness (tree vs detail vs editor)
- [01.1-01]: Corpus metadata stored as corpus-meta.json files per directory (not SQLite), matching existing JSON pattern
- [01.1-01]: Lazy import of _output_dir from api.main in route modules to avoid circular imports
- [01.1-01]: Upload validates all file extensions upfront before processing any, rejecting batch with 400
- [01.1-01]: ZIP extraction writes to sources dir directly, skipping __MACOSX entries and directories
- [01.1-03]: ConfirmDialog uses {@html} for message to support bold corpus names in delete confirmation
- [01.1-03]: Focus trap in ConfirmDialog manual (Tab/Shift+Tab interception), no external dependency
- [01.1-03]: Task 1 already committed by prior 01.1-01 execution -- verified and reused
- [01.1-02]: JobManager keyed by corpus_id (one job file per corpus) matching folio-enrich disk-based pattern
- [01.1-02]: Pipeline runner iterates orchestrator._stages directly to inject progress callbacks between stages
- [01.1-02]: SSE generator polls job file every 0.5s with typed events (status, activity, complete, error)
- [01.1-02]: Atomic writes use asyncio.to_thread() wrapping sync tempfile+os.replace to avoid blocking event loop

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Gold-standard validation set (50-100 annotated boundaries) requires manual annotation of source material
- [Phase 1]: LLM provider selection for extraction tasks needs benchmarking against advocacy text
